# Fitness Analysis Project

## Overview
Conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a fitness dataset to uncover key trends, patterns, and insights related to fitness metrics such as weight, activity levels, and health progress.

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values by filling or removing them.
   - Identified and treated outliers.
   - Performed feature scaling to ensure quality data for analysis.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Utilized various plots (histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to visualize data.
   - Created pie charts, bar plots, and heatmaps to identify correlations between features like exercise frequency, diet, and fitness outcomes.

3. **Analysis**:
   - Analyzed distributions of age, weight, and height.
   - Examined gender distribution and BMI distribution by gender.
   - Investigated activity patterns, including activity frequency over time and intensity distribution.
   - Explored health condition distribution and correlation matrix of key metrics.
   - Evaluated average weekly progress by gender and stress level distribution by gender.

## Key Insights
1. The most popular activity was Yoga.
2. The top three calorie-burning activities are HIIT, Running, and Cycling.
3. Most activities were performed on Wednesday.
4. Males make more progress over time than females in terms of physical activities.
5. All genders have almost the same fitness level.

## Tools Used

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into fitness trends and patterns, helping to understand the impact of various activities and health metrics on overall fitness progress.
